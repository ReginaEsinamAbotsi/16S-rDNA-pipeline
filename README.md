All CBIO related pipelines will go in here. At some point we will make things public. Currently we will be working on 16S processing. The next phase would be to include a contamination screening pipeline and then some full genome/exome/targeted sequencing pipelines.

* To get instructions on how to get up and running with the 16S rRNA gene analysis pipeline please go [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uRY8juvsuJpYmacqgC33NfUyphGGo4xzXMVUqreAYhQ)
